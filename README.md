# Overview

# Task Management Application

## Purpose
As a software engineer, continuous learning is key to enhancing problem-solving skills. This project aimed to deepen my understanding of JavaScript by creating a dynamic task management application.

## Software Description
This task management application is a lightweight and user-friendly tool designed to help users organize and manage their daily tasks effectively. The application allows users to:
- Input tasks with specific due dates.
- Group tasks automatically by their assigned dates.
- Toggle the visibility of task groups for better organization.
- Mark tasks as completed or move them back to active tasks.
- Remove tasks and task groups when they are no longer needed.
- Validate input dates to prevent selecting past dates.

The software leverages key JavaScript functionalities, such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with date objects, to create a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Purpose for Writing the Software
The primary goal of writing this software was to:

1. Strengthen my JavaScript skills by applying them in a practical project.
2. Gain experience in developing modular and maintainable code.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
## Tools Used
To develop this software, I used:
- **Visual Studio Code**: As the primary code editor, providing a robust environment with features like IntelliSense and debugging tools.
- **Git and GitHub**: For version control and collaboration, ensuring code changes were tracked and safely stored.
- **Google Chrome Developer Tools**: To debug and test the application's behavior directly in the browser.

## Programming Language and Libraries
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used to implement the application's functionality. JavaScript was chosen for its versatility and ability to create interactive, dynamic web applications.
- **HTML and CSS**: Used to structure and style the user interface, ensuring the application is both functional and visually appealing.

# Future Work
- Fix issue where I can't select today's date. 
- Deploy it in Render.com
- Remove To-Do date if it doesn't have any tasks.
